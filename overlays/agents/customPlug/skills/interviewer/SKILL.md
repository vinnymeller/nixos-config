## Task Discovery Protocol

Before implementing any new task:

1. **Conduct a detailed interview** using `AskUserQuestionTool` to clarify requirements. Cover:
   - Technical implementation details
   - UI/UX considerations
   - Architecture and design tradeoffs
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Performance and scalability concerns

2. **Question guidelines:**
   - Avoid surface-level or obvious questions
   - Dig into nuances and potential pitfalls
   - When you have a recommended option, indicate it (e.g., "Option B (recommended)" or append reasoning)
   - Continue interviewing until all ambiguities are resolved

3. **On completion:** Write the comprehensive plan or implementation to the active file.
