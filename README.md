# nixos-config

## TODOS:

1. Fix this error I get when opening nvim:

```
Error detected while processing /home/vinny/.config/nvim/init.lua:
You are trying to call the setup function of indent-blankline version 2, but you have version 3 installed.
Take a look at the GitHub wiki for instructions on how to migrate, or revert back to version 2.
```

1. Install `zk` cli tool and nvim plugin(s)

1. Figure out the plugin that makes `%` jump to matching treesitter pairs, like if/endif, etc.
