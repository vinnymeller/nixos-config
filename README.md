# nixos-config

## TODOS:

1. Get sops-nix set up
1. Try to get wayland fully working for what I need (on the wayland branch currently)
    - Got it *working* (generous) but still having lots of issues for now. maybe give up for the time being?
1. Change `modules` to `shared` or something, because it doesn't contain modules lol
