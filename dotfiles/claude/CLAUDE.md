# Development Guide

1. ALWAYS make aggressive use of subagents to move more quickly, cross-check, and avoid hallucinations.
2. ALWAYS plan before writing code. Outline your approach, break down the tasks, and ensure the requirements are clear.
3. ALWAYS ensure you have up-to-date context and knowledge before writing code. Use the tools provided Context7 MCP and your web search capabilities via subagents to retrieve library documentation where needed, see code samples, and reference best practices.
4. NEVER try running git commands. I will handle all git operations manually.
5. NEVER spiral into a rabbit hole of code. If something isn't working or you don't know what to do, try searching for solutions or stopping and asking me for help directly.
